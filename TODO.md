# TODO #

* Allow to enable/disable sites from the extension.
* Allow to disable completely.
* Try to increase quota of Stackoverflow with authentication/api key.
* Add Github scoring (+readme explanation).
* Order the classes with separators to separate must-be-implemented stuff and internals.
* Clean up `index.js` file (add anchor traverse class and extract the tagged attribute to constant).
* Added a default span to the icons so the links don't change places after the icon is loaded from spinner.
* Add grunt-chrome-package.
* Use mutation observers instead of dom events and improve performance for anchor searching.
